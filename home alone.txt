I have an idea:

"Home Alone: New Chapter"

It stars Caitlyn McCallister, a 9-year old girl, who is daughter of now adult Kevin. When she got in beef with her family, about spending christmas together, she was accidently left home alone (not really, because her black cat Grouchy was with her). Meanwhile, a wanted robber trio, led by Miranda, planning on revenge of what McCallisters did to her dad, Harry.

So the characters are:

Caitlyn McCallister, the main character, a creative and clever 9-year old, who is left home alone.
Kevin McCallister (played by Macaulay Culkin), Caitlyn's dad, Chayenne's husband, now home security tech, the co-planner of the Bahamas christmas vacation with relatives.
Chayenne McCallister (played by Brenda Song), Kevin's wife, Caitlyn's mother, fashion designer, the co-planner of the Bahamas christmas vacation with relatives.
Grouchy the black cat.

The other relatives:

Kate McCallister (played by Catherine O'Hara), Caitlyn's grandmother, Kevin's mom, who became less panicked and more joyful.
Buzz McCallister (Devin Ratray) and Megan Marlow McCallister (played by Hillary Wolf), Caitlyn's uncle and aunt, Kevin's siblings, who became more better people.
Sarah Marlow (19) (played by Emma Myers) and Annie Marlow (11), Megan's daughters, Caitlyn's cousins, Sarah is an influencer, and Annie is more of genius.
Robert McCalister (7), Buzz's son, Caitlyn's "other" cousin, who's a trickster

The robbers:

Miranda (played by Sandra Bullock), a wanted mastermind, experianced robber, planning revenge
